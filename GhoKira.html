    <h1>Gho and Kira, the traditionnal dress of Bhutan</h1>
    <p>There was a time when you could often tell where a person was from by looking at their outfits, but with modernisation, traditional attires are slowly becoming something of the past and people are wearing easier outfits often inspired by trends. 

        <p>In Bhutan however, the traditional dress of Gho for the men and Kira for the women is not something of the past. Bhutanese traditional attire is uniquely different in the sense that it is not only colourful and eye-catching but also holds immense cultural value. What Bhutanese wear is not just pieces of fabrics sewn together. They are the expression of the unique identity and culture of Bhutan</p>
        
        <p>On any ordinary day, you will see Bhutanese people walking down the street or entering into workplaces with colourful Ghos and Kiras draped around gracefully.</p>
        
        <h2>The Bhutanese traditional dress for men</h2>
        <h5>The Gho</h5>
        <p>The men in Bhutan wear a knee-length robe wrapped around their bodies and tied
             securely with a belt. It forms a pouch that is dubbed as
              ‘the largest pocket in the world’ by foreigners. Men wear it every day when they
               go to work and during formal occasions and gatherings. 
               It is a requirement that men wear gho especially if they work in government sectors. 
               It is also a requirement in schools and colleges alike across the country. </p>
        <h2>Bhutanese traditional dress for women: </h2>
        <h5>The Kira</h5>
        <p>The women in Bhutan dress elegantly in an ankle-length dress known as Kira. They are firmly fastened at the shoulders with either simple pins or complicated silver brooches also known as Koma. This is one way of wearing it. The other way is to wear it like a skirt down the waist, we refer to it as half Kira.</p>
        <p>Traditionally they were handwoven with intricated designs and patterns made of raw silk. Nowadays they can be machine-made with cotton and other fibres. On special occasions, women wear bright coloured, complex-designed Kiras whereas, on ordinary days, they wear light weighted and simple patterned Kiras. Keeping in line with fashion, women in Bhutan these days match their Kiras with accessories, blouses, and even footwear. </p>
